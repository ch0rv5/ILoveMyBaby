        <h1>
            A website for my baby, while you're away on vacation.
        </h1>
        
        <p>
            <h3>Hi baby!!! Here is the surprise! :D I hope you find it cool! If you're reading this it means that it worked, 
                it's so complex TwT. I thought of making some sort of blog, but I 
                wanted to add a bit of personal touch into it!</h3> 
        </p>
        <p>
            It may be a bit unnecesary, but I thought it could be fun, and I'd have a reason to learn to code this stuff! 
            When you're back you should check out all the fancy code stuff on my pc! It feels so sneaky to make a surprise like this 
            hehe :3!!! 
        </p>
        <p>
            Anyways! Get to the chase Nik amiright? :P I'm gonna try to update this website every day! Like a virtual diary!
            That way I/we can look back on this and stuff yk! And I need something to distract myself hehe, so I thought why the 
            heck not??  
            <br>
            Don't be surprised if the website gets more advanced over time! I'm slowly learning :D Right now it's just a blank white page
            with text on it! It's not even online :o!!! You best believe I'm ranting about this when you get back! :D 
            <br>
            I want to add a background, and color, and gifs and pictures and everything!!!
            Right now I only know how to add text, and make it function! Actually, I'm gonna test it out right now :]
